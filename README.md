# oemof tutorial on modeling heat pumps

Welcome to the documentation of the oemof session at the 2nd International workshop on "Open Source Modelling and
Simulation of Energy Systems". The workshop has been developed by [Francesco Witte](https://github.com/fwitte) and
[Patrik Sch√∂nfeld](https://github.com/p-snft) at the German Areospace Center (DLR), Institute of Networked Energy
Systems.

You will learn how to use and apply the two most know oemof libraries, i.e.
[oemof.solph](https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph) [TESPy](https://github.com/oemof/tespy), in the context of modeling
heat pumps in energy system analysis. If you would like to add more contents you are welcome to open a pull request on
the repository.

The workshop is available as online tutorial on [this website](https://oemof.github.io/heat-pump-tutorial/). You
will find all relevant information on installing required software packages etc. on that page.
