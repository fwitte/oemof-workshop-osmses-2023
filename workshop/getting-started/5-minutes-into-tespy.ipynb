    "## General information\n",
    "\n",
    "[TESPy](https://tespy.readthedocs.io) is an open-source framework for the\n",
    "simulation of component based thermodynamic conversion processes. With the\n",
    "software you can used predefined components such as a pump, compressor, heat\n",
    "exhcanger, turbine or valve (and many more) to build thermodynamic systems. The\n",
    "system is set up by connecting the components in a generic way and then\n",
    "specifying respective process and component parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software then performs a steady state simulation of your system by creating\n",
    "and solving a system of equations in the so called *equation oriented (EO)*\n",
    "approach (see {cite}`Witte2022` for more information). The system represents the\n",
    "individual topology and compoent and process specifications provided by you.\n",
    "TESPy accomplishes this by solving for\n",

    "of every connections between two components[^fluid-variable]. After solving a\n",
    "model, missing component and process parameters - for example: efficiencies,\n",
    "temperatures, pressure losses - are determined based on these information. The\n",
    "EO approach lets the modeler choose, which parameters are inputs and which\n",
    "parameters are results: For instance, a compressor efficiency can be an input\n",
    "and the system variables are solved to meet that constraint, or it can be a\n",
    "result of other inputs.\n",
