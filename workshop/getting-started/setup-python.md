# Setup your Python environment

The tutorials have been created based on the latest versions of

- `oemof-solph` and
- `tespy`

Make sure, you have installed your favorite python on your machine, e.g.
[plain python](https://www.python.org/) or
[miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), and a code editor. We
recommend, you create a virtual environment and install the dependencies to
that environment:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar-paypal.git@issue/34/oscar-0.6
```
